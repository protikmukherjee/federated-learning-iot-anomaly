# Federated Learning for IoT Anomaly Detection

This project implements a Federated Learning (FL) framework for anomaly detection in IoT-based smart cities. The framework integrates advanced models such as Transformers and Autoencoders to handle both IID and non-IID data distributions effectively.

## Features

- Federated Learning algorithms: FedAvg and FedProx
- Transformer-based anomaly detection for temporal dependencies
- Autoencoder integration for robust feature representation
- Evaluation on the N-BaIoT dataset with IID and non-IID configurations

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is [N-BaIoT](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/xiaofeizhu/bot-iot-dataset). It includes IoT device traffic data for anomaly detection.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/federated-learning-iot-anomaly.git
   cd federated-learning-iot-anomaly
